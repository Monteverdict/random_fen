# random_fen
Tool to generate random chess positions using Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN).
It also shows a preview of the positions using unicode chess symbols. Sometimes it will generate invalid positions, so before pasting the generated FEN check the preview and see whether:

a) both Kings are in check.

b) the Kings are touching.

In all other cases, simply switching the color of the player next to move will resolve the issue.
