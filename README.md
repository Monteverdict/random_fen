# random_fen
Tool to generate random chess positions using Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN). They can be generated by manually inputting pieces in the terminal (total pieces or per side), by randomly generating the pieces as well, or using presets for pieces.
Together with FEN, it shows a preview of the position. Sometimes it will generate invalid positions, so before pasting the generated FEN check the preview and see whether:

1. both Kings are in check.

2. the Kings are touching.

In all other cases, simply switching the color of the player next to move will resolve the issue.
